# Tomato leaf disease classification using Deep learning

- This project is using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyark/potato-leaf-disease-97-100-accuracy/data) from kaggle

- I did not used all the dataset, i had just used the tomato leaf data.

- I had added tomato data to this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LuQ4d7Zx4s6bv-rofeO0HDT6F7ddqVW2?usp=sharing).

- The model accuracy is 91%
